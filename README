On Windows Server 2008 you need to create the following directories to get this to work:

Windows 2008 Server x64: C:\Windows\SysWOW64\config\systemprofile\Desktop
Windows 2008 Server x86: C:\Windows\System32\config\systemprofile\Desktop

Add write permission to desktop folder and you are done

Change the app pool identity to local system or any other high-previleged account
make sure the account has the right to write

Done.
